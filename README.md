### Spot Search

Spot Search is google for music. It allows you to search for tracks,albums and artists, all from the same screen. Results are organized as cards. Clicking these cards will take you straight to the spotify web player. Aside from that , Spot search also comes with a familiar , "I am feeling lucky" button that allows users to jump directly to spotify for the first search result.

Spot search was developed at a hackathon in under 15-20 hours. The code quality is only passable at best. You can check the main submission [here](https://www.devpost.com/software/spot-search)
